DETAILED PLAN FOR NEXT PHASE

I'll analyze what's missing and plan the next implementation phase for the Legion Toolkit Linux version.


üîç Current Analysis:

After reviewing the completed work, I've identified several critical components that are referenced but not yet implemented:


üì¶ Missing Components to Implement:

1. System Resources & Desktop Integration
Resources/legion-toolkit.desktop - Desktop file for application launcher
Resources/legion-toolkit.svg - Application icon (SVG format)
Resources/legion-toolkit.png - Application icon (PNG format)
Resources/legion-toolkit.ico - Icon for cross-platform compatibility

2. Systemd Service Files
Scripts/legion-toolkit.service - User systemd service
Scripts/legion-toolkit-system.service - System-wide systemd service

3. Build Scripts
Scripts/build-deb.sh - Debian package builder
Scripts/build-rpm.sh - RPM package builder
Scripts/uninstall.sh - Uninstallation script (referenced but not created)

4. Additional Services (Optional but Important)
Services/Linux/LinuxGpuService.cs - GPU control (switching, performance modes)
Services/Interfaces/IGpuService.cs - GPU service interface
ViewModels/GpuViewModel.cs - GPU control view model
Views/GpuView.axaml - GPU control UI

5. Testing Infrastructure
Tests/LenovoLegionToolkit.Avalonia.Tests.csproj - Test project
Unit tests for services
Integration tests for hardware interaction

6. CI/CD Configuration
.github/workflows/build-linux.yml - GitHub Actions for Linux builds
.github/workflows/release.yml - Automated release workflow

7. Documentation Files
CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution guidelines
CHANGELOG.md - Version history
LICENSE - MIT license file

üéØ Proposed Implementation Order:

Phase 1: Critical System Files (Highest Priority)

Create systemd service files (required for installation)
Create desktop entry and icons (required for GUI launch)
Create remaining build scripts (for packaging)

Phase 2: GPU Support (Medium Priority)

Implement GPU service for NVIDIA/AMD switching
Add GPU view and view model
Integrate with existing navigation

Phase 3: Testing & CI/CD (Important for Maintenance)

Set up test project structure
Create unit tests for critical services
Add GitHub Actions workflows

Phase 4: Documentation (Final Polish)

Create CONTRIBUTING.md
Create CHANGELOG.md
Add LICENSE file

üí° Recommended Next Step:

I recommend starting with Phase 1: Critical System Files as these are essential for the application to be properly installed and run on Linux systems. Without these files:

The systemd services referenced in install scripts won't work
The application won't appear in desktop menus
Package building will fail

üìù Phase 1 Detailed Changes:

Create systemd service files:
Scripts/legion-toolkit.service - User-level service for GUI
Scripts/legion-toolkit-system.service - System service for hardware control

Create desktop integration resources:
Resources/legion-toolkit.desktop - Desktop entry file
Resources/legion-toolkit.svg - Scalable vector icon
Generate PNG versions for different sizes

Create build scripts:
Scripts/build-deb.sh - Build Debian packages
Scripts/build-rpm.sh - Build RPM packages
Update Scripts/uninstall.sh with proper cleanup

Create basic resource files:
Icon designs for the application
Desktop file with proper categories and keywords

These files are critical for:

System integration (systemd)
Desktop environment integration (menu entries)
Package distribution (build scripts)
Professional appearance (icons)

Would you like me to proceed with implementing Phase 1: Critical System Files? This will ensure the application can be properly installed and launched on Linux systems.
